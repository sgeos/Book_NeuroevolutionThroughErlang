# Neuroevolution Through Erlang, Book Source Code

A repository for source code as I work through the book
[Handbook of Neuroevolution Through Erlang][book-neuroevolution-erlang].
This repository uses [version 3 of GNU General Public License][license-gnu-gpl-v3] because that is
what the [official source code repository for the book][book-neuroevolution-erlang-source] uses.

**Note:**  Some of code may be slightly different from the official repository.
Considering referring to the official repository instead of this one.
